    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Steam is a popular digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers a vast library of video games, software, and other multimedia content. It provides both a desktop application and a web platform, allowing users to purchase, download, and play their favorite games with ease. The platform is known for its vast selection, user-friendly interface, and frequent sales, making it a go-to choice for gamers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are intelligent algorithms designed to provide personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences, behavior, or other relevant factors. These systems analyze data patterns to predict and recommend items that are likely to be of interest, enhancing user experience and engagement with the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steam uses a recommendation system to suggest games that users might be interested in based on their play history, friends' activity, and other factors. However, not all users log in when browsing the Steam store through a web browser, resulting in a lack of access to personalized data such as their game library and play history. This limitation poses a challenge to provide relevant game recommendations to users who are not logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business question\n",
    "\n",
    "The business question addressed in this project is: <br>\n",
    "How can a recommendation system for the Steam platform that relies solely on game similarities be built, without requiring users to log in or access their personal library and play history? \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will enable Steam to provide valuable suggestions to users who browse the platform without logging in, potentially increasing engagement and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The following three datasets from Kaggle have been used in this project to build the game similarity-based recommendation system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. steam.csv\n",
    "This dataset contains general information about the games available on Steam, including their title, release date, developer, publisher, genres, and other relevant details. The dataset has the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name**: The title of the game.\n",
    "- **release_date**: The date the game was released.\n",
    "- **english**: A binary indicator of whether the game supports the English language (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- **developer**: The developer responsible for creating the game.\n",
    "- **publisher**: The company responsible for publishing the game.\n",
    "- **platforms**: The platforms the game is available on (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux).\n",
    "- **required_age**: The minimum age requirement to play the game, according to ESRB ratings or similar guidelines.\n",
    "- **categories**: A list of categories that describe the game's features (e.g., Single-player, Multi-player, Co-op).\n",
    "- **genres**: The genre(s) the game belongs to.\n",
    "- **steamspy_tags**: The top three tags associated with the game, according to SteamSpy data.\n",
    "- **achievements**: The number of achievements available in the game.\n",
    "- **positive_ratings**: The number of positive ratings the game has received from users.\n",
    "- **negative_ratings**: The number of negative ratings the game has received from users.\n",
    "- **average_playtime**: The average playtime of the game, in minutes, among users who have played the game.\n",
    "- **median_playtime**: The median playtime of the game, in minutes, among users who have played the game.\n",
    "- **owners**: An estimated range of the total number of users who own the game (e.g., \"20000-50000\").\n",
    "- **price**: The current price of the game in USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is essential for the project as it provides the basic information about the games and allows for identifying the key characteristics of each game to be used in the similarity calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. steam_description_data.csv\n",
    "This dataset provides additional information about the games in the form of descriptive texts, including a short description, detailed description, and other related texts. The columns in this dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **steam_appid**: Unique identifier for each game, matching the appid in steam.csv.\n",
    "- **detailed_description**: A more comprehensive description of the game, often including gameplay features and storyline.\n",
    "- **about_the_game**: A brief overview of the game, highlighting its main features and selling points.\n",
    "- **short_description**: A concise summary of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive texts in this dataset are important for understanding the content and context of each game. By analyzing these texts, relevant features can be extracted to determine the similarities between games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. steamspy_tag_data.csv\n",
    "This dataset contains user-generated tags for each game, which help categorize and describe the games in more detail. The columns in this dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **appid**: Unique identifier for each game, matching the appid in steam.csv.\n",
    "- **[tag_name]**: Each column represents a different tag, and the value in each cell indicates the number of times that tag has been applied to the corresponding game by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user-generated tags in this dataset provide valuable insights into the popular features and characteristics of each game, as perceived by the community. Analyzing these tags helps us to determine the similarities between games based on the preferences and opinions of Steam users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the information from these three datasets, a comprehensive understanding of each game's features, content, and user perception can be created. This data will enable us to build an effective similarity-based recommendation system for users who browse the Steam platform without logging in.\n"

    "Before building the recommendation system, I explored the `steam` DataFrame and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "- 77% of the dataset has implicit missing values for the `average_playtime` column, making it unsuitable for use in the recommendation system.\n",
    "- 511 games are not in English. These will be removed to focus on English-language games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "1. Drop the non-English games from the `steam` DataFrame.\n",
    "2. Remove unnecessary columns that are not relevant for the recommendation system: ['platforms', 'average_playtime', 'median_playtime', 'price', 'required_age', 'achievements', 'steamspy_tags', 'english'].\n"

    "## Transforming Rating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To better utilize the rating data and incorporate the number of owners as a weighting method for the rating, the `rating_df` DataFrame is transformed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation Steps\n",
    "1. Compute a new column `rating_score` by dividing the positive ratings by the total number of ratings.\n",
    "2. Convert the 'owners' column into a normalized scale based on the number of owners.\n",
    "3. Compute the `weighted_rating` by multiplying the `rating_score` and the normalized `owners` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of this approach include:\n",
    "- The rating score provides a more meaningful metric to compare games by accounting for both positive and negative ratings.\n",
    "- The weighted rating takes into consideration the number of owners, giving more weight to popular games and mitigating the impact of games with a smaller user base that may have skewed ratings.\n",

    "## Calculating Similarity Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions to calculate similarity scores were created for each DataFrame using different methods based on the nature of the information stored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Developers and Publishers DataFrames**: We calculated a score based on the number of common developers or publishers between the target game and the compared game, taking into account the total number of developers or publishers for each. A score of 1 is given if all developers or publishers are the same, 0.8 if at least half of the developers or publishers are the same, 0.5 if there is at least one common developer or publisher, and 0 otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tags, Genres, and Categories DataFrames**: We used the Jaccard similarity index to calculate a score based on the similarity of the tags, genres, or categories between the target game and the compared game. Having a multilabel list of tags and genres fits well with Jaccard similarity because it is a measure designed to compare sets, making it a suitable choice for situations where data is in the form of unordered lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description and Tags DataFrames**: The cosine similarity is used to calculate a score based on the similarity of the game descriptions between the target game and the compared game. Having a large number of standardized continuous values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1 fits well with cosine similarity because it effectively captures the angle between two vectors, providing a meaningful measure of similarity of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Release Date DataFrame**: We used a simple score based on the proximity of the release date of the target game and the compared game. A smoothing factor has been added, applying the power of a float number between 0 and 1 to the original score (between 0 and 1) to smooth the values. This approach ensures that small differences in release dates do not lead to a significant impact on the overall similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rating DataFrame**: The rating DataFrame stayed the same because it had been normalized previously, and the weighted rating already provides a meaningful metric for comparison.\n"

    "In this section, I created five functions to get similar games based on features and scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 1: score_tab\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes the target game index and the stored dataframes as input, and calculates the scores for each feature, such as developers, publishers, genres, categories, tags, ratings, release dates, and descriptions. It then joins these scores into a single DataFrame and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 2: get_score\n",
    "\n",
    "This function combines all the scores from the first function into a single score by assigning different weights to each feature based on their importance. These weights were determined through knowledge of video games, discussions with gamers, and testing. The function then sorts the games by their total score and returns the top 30 similar games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights in this function are designed to give more importance to games released around the same time as the target game. This is based on the assumption that users looking for a specific game might be more interested in other games from the same time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 3: get_score_new_games\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is similar to the previous one but adjusts the weights to give more importance to the release date, specifically favoring newer games. This function was created to ensure that the recommendation system also includes new games for users to discover, regardless of the target game's release date. The other weights in this function were fine-tuned through extensive testing with known games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 4: get_results\n",
    "\n",
    "This function combines the results from the `get_score` and `get_score_new_games` functions by selecting the top 4 similar games and 3 random games from the top 30, and then removing any common games from the similar recent games list. It then adds the top 3 new games and 2 random games from the new games list, resulting in a total of 12 recommended games, which is the same number of games Steam displays on their website. The function then shuffles the results randomly and returns them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 5: get_recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes a game index as input and calls all the previous functions to provide the 12 recommended games in a single line of code. The final recommendations include a mix of similar games, random selections from the top matches, and a focus on both new and older games to provide a diverse set of recommendations for the user.\n"

    "In this game recommendation system, a variety of techniques ad been used to find and recommend similar games for users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key techniques and their advantages are:\n",
    "- Jaccard similarity for comparing categorical features like genres and categories, which is effective in measuring similarity between sets of items.\n",
    "- Cosine similarity for comparing continuous features like tags and description vectors, which can capture the similarity between items even if they are not identical.\n",
    "- Weighted scores for combining various features based on their importance, which provides a comprehensive similarity score that takes multiple aspects of the games into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recommendations system acheived comparable results to the ones suggested by Steam on their website and some suggested games are shared. The system's running time is approximately 1.45 seconds when the precomputed tables are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some limitations, such as time constraints, limited resources, and access to more data that could potentially improve the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible expansions for this recommendation system include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluating user comments on games, although this may be biased due to the tendency of users to write short negative reviews and the potential for sentiment analysis to be misleading for certain genres like horror or gore games.\n",
    "- Recommending games that are similar to the ones in a registered user's library or most-played list, which would provide a more personalized set of recommendations.\n",
    "- Recommending games that are similar to those in the libraries of other users who have the target game in their libraries, based on playtime and other data that we did not have access to.\n",
    "- ncorporating Steam users' libraries analysis to identify clusters of users with similar preferences and recommend games that are popular within these clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these limitations and implementing the suggested expansions, it would be possible to further improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the game recommendation system, providing users with an even better experience when discovering new games to play.\n"
